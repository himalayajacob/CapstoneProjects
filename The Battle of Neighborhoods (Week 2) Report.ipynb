Methodology"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The Strategy to find the answer:\n\nThe strategy is based on mapping the described data in section 2.0, in order to facilitate the choice of at least two candidate places for rent. The information will be consolidated in ONE MAP where one can see the details of the apartment, the cluster of venues in the neighborhood and the relative location from a subway station and from work place. A measurement tool icon will also be provided. The popups on the map items will display rent price, location and cluster of venues applicable.\n\nThe Tools: Web-scraping of sites is used to consolidate data-frame information which was saved as csv files for convenience and to simply the report. Geodata was obtained by coding a program to use Nominatim to get latitude and longitude of subway stations and also for each of (144 units) the apartments for rent listed.\n\nGeopy_distance and Nominatim were used to establish relative distances. Seaborn graphic was used for general statistics on rental data.\n\nMaps with popups labels allow quick identification of location, price and feature, thus making the selection very easy."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# 4.
